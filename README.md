# Electric Car Project

# Overview

This electric car project was a collaborative effort with university students who assisted with the mechanical aspects of the build, while I led the design, engineering, and technical implementation. By utilizing two 48V brushless DC motors and applying innovative control and integration techniques, I transformed the vehicle into a practical solution for eco-friendly transportation.

# Technical Details

Motors and Controllers:

The car operates with two 48V brushless DC motors, managed by dedicated controllers. I unified both motor throttles into a single accelerator pedal, creating smooth and responsive handling.

Battery Configuration: 

The batteries are connected in parallel to ensure balanced energy distribution, enhancing the vehicle's range and performance.
Collaboration

This project was made possible with the support of university students who contributed their expertise in mechanical engineering. Their work on the structural aspects complemented my technical lead role, demonstrating teamwork and knowledge sharing.
